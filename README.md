**Key Components:**

    LSTM Model: The model will predict the price direction (up/down) based on past price data and indicators.
    Binance API: The code interacts with the Binance Testnet API to place orders (buy/sell) and manage positions.
    Data Preprocessing: The data is normalized and reshaped into a format suitable for LSTM.
    Training and Prediction: The model will be trained on the historical price data and will make real-time predictions for trade decisions.
