**Key Components:**

    LSTM Model: The model will predict the price direction (up/down) based on past price data and indicators.
    Binance API: The code interacts with the Binance Testnet API to place orders (buy/sell) and manage positions.
    Data Preprocessing: The data is normalized and reshaped into a format suitable for LSTM.
    Training and Prediction: The model will be trained on the historical price data and will make real-time predictions for trade decisions.

Explanation of Key Components:

    Data Preprocessing:
        The preprocess_data function scales the closing price using MinMaxScaler and creates sequences for training the LSTM. The target y is 1 if the price goes up and 0 if it goes down (binary classification).

    LSTM Model:
        The create_lstm_model function defines the LSTM architecture. It uses two LSTM layers with Dropout to avoid overfitting and a Dense layer for the output with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

    Trading Logic:
        The bot checks whether there is an open position with check_open_position. If no position is open, it predicts the market direction using the trained LSTM model. It then places a BUY or SELL order based on the prediction.
        The position is closed immediately after every trade. You can add more complex logic for closing positions based on your strategy.

    Training:
        The model is trained using historical price data and then used for real-time predictions. The LSTM model is trained in epochs (default 10) to learn from the historical data before executing trades.

    Trade Execution:
        The place_order function executes a market order on Binance to either open a long or short position based on the LSTM prediction.

Testing:

    Testnet: Ensure you are using the Binance Testnet with the provided api_key and secret_key. The Testnet environment allows you to test the bot without risking real funds.
    Optimization: You can experiment with hyperparameters like the number of LSTM units, lookback periods, and epochs to optimize performance.

Important Notes:
